## Inspiration

During this Covid-19 era, many of us spend most of our days hunched over a
desk, leaning forward looking at a computer screen, or slumped down in our
chair. If you’re like me, you’re only reminded of your bad posture when your neck
or shoulders hurt hours later, or you have a splitting migraine. These problems
appear gradually if the person repeatedly assumes incorrect postures for a
prolonged period of time. 
Studies have indicated that an incorrect posture can lead to a host of ailments, including exacerbating arthritis, breathing difficulty, headaches, among others.

## What it does

Posturino (Posture Monitoring AI Web application with hardware wearable device)

A wearable IoT device for the people who are doing day-to-day works and also working in front of the computer.
Alarm if the proper posture angle is not maintained.

## How we built it

Material Required

Ball Switch Module

Arduino UNO

Buzzer

LED

Resistor - 10k ohm

Breadboard

Connecting wires (M-M)

This is a Mercury switch-based tilt sensor module that gives high at its output pin when tilted. It requires a 5V of DC input. It’s a four-terminal device consist of VCC, GND, A0, V0. It has a glass tube consist of two electrodes and a liquid mercury ball. The liquid mercury ball closes and opens the circuit when inclined in a particular direction. 

whenever the Tilt sensor is inclined beyond a particular angle the Output of the tilt sensor gets HIGH. This output is read through Pin. Therefore, whenever Pin is HIGH, it turns ON the LED and Buzzer and gives an alarm.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The main purpose of this project is to develop a simple, economical, and effective means to optimize the body posture under cases where modification in the tasks or work environment can prove very costly, unsafe, and difficult.

## What we learned

IoT wearable devices architecture.

## What's next for Posturino

We will look for more solutions and will try to create more cost-effective devices in order to maintain proper health well-being.
